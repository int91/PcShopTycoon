# Pc Shop Tycoon

This is a prototype for what was supposed to be a 3d computer building game.

This game was made using Unity3D and C#. This is my first and only 3D game.

I made this after not messing around with Unity for about 2 years. It turned out decent for a first game anyway. It's basically fully functional, just lacks features that were gonna be in the full game.
